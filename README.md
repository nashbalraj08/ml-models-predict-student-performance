# Machine Learning Models to Predict Student Performance

## Overview
The goal of applying these machine learning models is to predict the target variable within the prediction error threshold that generalizes well on unseen data providing insight on student performance 

## Features
- Applying Linear and Non-linear Models
- OLS regression, Ridge regression, LASSO regression, Elastic net regression
- Regression tree
- Support vector regression: linear SVR Model and non-linear SVR Model
- K-nearest neighbour
- Neural network
- Visualize the MAE of each model for the training and test set

## Installation
1. Clone the repository in R-studio:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nashbalraj08/ml-models-predict-student-performance.git
2. Run
