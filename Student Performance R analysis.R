"OUTPUT:
The summary statistics suggest a reasonable spread of final grades with some 
moderate skew due to the extreme values(students who performed either very poorly 
or exceptionally well),with grades ranging from 0 to 19.

The mean (11.91) and median (12) are quite close, which indicates a symmetric
distribution. However, the fact that the min is 0 and the max is 19, and the 
1st quartile (10) and 3rd quartile (14) points span a 
reasonable range, but there may be a slight skew.

The standard deviation (3.2) indicates a moderate spread around the mean 
(11.91). This means most grades tend to be within (+-)3.2 of the average.

The interquartile range (4) suggests that 
the middle 50% of students' grades are relatively tightly packed, which indicates 
a moderate concentration of grades around the median.

According to histogram
The mean, median, and the most common grades cluster around 9 to 12, 
indicating that most students performed in this range.

Slight Left Skew: The slight left skew in the distribution indicates that there 
are some lower outliers (students with grades of 0-5 points, but the bulk of students 
performed around the middle range.

High Achievers: A smaller group of students scored near the maximum (19 points), 
showing that some students performed exceptionally well.

"OUTPUT:
The black line within the box represents the median final grade,This indicates 
that half of the students scored less than or equal to 12, and other half scored higher.

Q1: The lower edge of the box corresponds to the first quartile (Q1), 
meaning 25% of students scored below 10 points.
Q3: The upper edge of the box represents the third quartile (Q3), 
meaning 75% of students scored below 14 points

Min (0): The minimum grade is 0 points, which could represent students who 
either failed or did not participate.
Max (19): The maximum grade is 19, indicating that the highest-performing 
students achieved perfect scores. 
 
what level of prediction error you deem to be acceptable for the response variable 

Given this distribution, most student grades are clustered between 10 and 14. 
The mean is approximately 11.93, and the median is 12. Also, the standard deviation(3.2)
indicates a moderate spread around the mean (11.91).This means most grades tend 
to be within (+-)3.2 points of the average.
Errors larger than 4 points, as this is higher than IQR range is unacceptable as they 
could represent a considerable gap relative to the performance indicators within 
this dataset.
Therefore, 2 points of prediction error is acceptable for the response variable,
Final Grade.

How complex do the relationships in your data appear to be?

After exploring the dataset, it is clear that the relationships between the 
variables are complex. This complexity arises from the combination of both 
categorical and numerical variables, and how they relate to the target 
variable(final grade). While comparing each attribute individually 
to the final grade shows some degree of relationship, 
evaluating the attributes one by one doesnâ€™t provide a comprehensive picture.

For example, one might assume that students with good health would perform 
better academically. However, the box plot analysis reveals that there is no 
clear correlation between better health and higher grades. 
In fact, students with poorer health statuses (rated 1 and 2) 
show competitive median grades compared to those with better health statuses.
This suggests that although health may influence academic performance, 
it may not be as strong or direct a predictor as initially expected. 
Other factors such as student freetime, extra academic support, 
or studytime might play more significant roles.

Another assumption could be that students with more free time after school 
would dedicate this time to their studies and achieve higher grades. However, 
the scatter plot with a trend line indicates a slight negative slope. 
This suggests that students with more free time may, in fact, have slightly 
lower final grades, though the trend is subtle. Therefore, analyzing 
variables in isolation makes it difficult to draw meaningful insights, and 
other factors likely contribute to student performance.

In conclusion, the relationships in my dataset appear to be highly complex, 
and it is challenging to derive clear interpretations by examining each 
variable individually. Hopefully, using machine learning models, may provide 
deeper insights into what influences student performance.

"OUTPUT:
We use the test set to see if the data generalizes well with the data by 
predicting the value on test set
Since the r2_score in test set(0.115) is lower than training set(0.37), we expect this due 
to generalization error. 

MAE as we expect the MAE error on test set 2.13 is higher training test set 1.87,
This indicates that the model performs slightly better on the training data 
compared to unseen data (test set). 


Bias: training performance (with an MAE of 1.8) is relatively close to the 
test performance (MAE of 2.13), indicating that the model doesn't have high bias.

Variance: training and test errors (MAE) are reasonably close, 
which suggests that the model doesn't suffer from high variance.we can conclude 
that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Elastic Net: Training (1.88) is within the criterion, but Test (2.09) 
  slightly exceeds it. The model performs well on training data but shows a

The models slightly exceed the acceptance level of 2 points. 
OLS and Elastic Net perform better than Ridge and Lasso, but none are

Since regression trees only allow for binary splits : 
e.g. if failures categories are 1 class, 2 classes, 3 classes and no failures
The regression tree will group this into two (binary splits) = 
0(1 class, 2 classes, 3 classes ) and 1 (no failures)
yes --> 0(1 class, 2 classes, 3 classes )
no --> 1 (no failures)

Darker the blue the higher average of student grades

The most influential factor seems to be failures, indicating that students who 
have failed multiple classes tend to have lower final grades. 
This is a reasonable outcome as past failures likely indicate struggles in 
academic performance.

Absences: The second split on the left branch considers absences as an 
important predictor. Students with fewer absences (<1) are likely to achieve a 
final grade of around 9.5 or 9.8, which is higher than students with more absences.

MJOb:On the left-most side, the split considers the mothers's job as a relevant 
variable (specifically the other category). It indicates that students whose mothers 
have a job classified as other might be linked to slightly lower grade

Medu (Mother's Education): On the right branch, Medu (the education level of the mother) 
also plays a significant role. Students whose mothers have a higher level of education 
tend to score higher final grades.

Study time also comes up as a split point, with students studying fewer than 5 
hours have lower grades compared to students with more than 5 hours have higher average grades.

Mjob=at home indicates mother at home help stdunets achieve higher average grades

identify Important attributes by position of attributes 
Seeking  higher education and how many failures 

The entire dataset is divided into students who had class failures (1-3 classes)
and those who did not. This is the most significant split in predicting final grades.

Class Failures and Absences are the most influential variables in predicting a studentâ€™s 
final grade. Students who had failures and many absences tend to perform worse, 
with final grades ranging from 3.3 to 7.2.

Students whose mothers have jobs categorized as other have lower predicted 
final grades of 5.6, 3.3, or 7.2

 Students who do not intend to pursue higher education are still performing 
 relatively well with a predicted grade of around 13.

Higher = yes: These students also have a predicted grade of 13, showing a 
generally higher level of performance.

Mother's Job (Mjob = other) is relevant for students who have experienced 
class failures and have minimal absences. This suggests that socioeconomic 
factors or the work status of the mother may influence student outcomes.

Desire to Pursue Higher Education is a strong predictor of better performance,
which aligns with the notion that students aiming for higher education may be 
more motivated or better prepared academically.

"output:
SVM_Linear:The difference between the training and test errors indicates a slight 
overfitting, as the test errors are noticeably higher. However, this model 
performs relatively well compared to the others, especially in terms of MAE.

SVM_RBF:This model has a better balance between the training and test set errors, 
suggesting that the RBF kernel provides better generalization compared to the linear model.

SVM_Polynomial:The test set errors are higher than the training set errors, but 
the overall performance is similar to the RBF kernel, indicating moderate generalization.

The SVM_Linear model has the highest test error (3.09 RMSE), indicating 
overfitting compared to the others.
SVM_RBF seems to have the best balance between training and test errors,
suggesting it generalizes well.
SVM_Polynomial performs similarly to SVM_RBF but with slightly higher test errors.
Given your acceptance criterion of 2 points for MAE, the models slightly 
exceed this threshold, but the SVM_RBF appears to provide the most stable 
performance. You might consider tuning the parameters further to improve 
generalization across models.

"output:
The RMSE and MAE on the training set are lower than those on the test set, 
indicating that the model performs slightly better on the training data. 
However, the difference is not large, suggesting that the model generalizes 
reasonably well to unseen data.
The difference in MAE and RMSE between the training and test sets is relatively 
small, meaning that the model is neither overfitting nor underfitting severely.
